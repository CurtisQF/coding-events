# coding-events
Code along LC project

App Purpose:
Allow users to input Coding Events and access those events. Allow for the creation of Coding Event categories and ability to view events of each particular category.

Current State:
Large number of branches created as a code-along study for the class LaunchCode101.

Future Improvements:
Add a person class to allow users to register for an event. Will require a connection to Events and possibly more. Additional improvements as the text progresses.
